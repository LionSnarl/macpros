# Homebrew
Homebrew is a package manager for Mac. It can install most apps and technologies. Homebrew will ensure proper installation processes as well as give you access to brew commands. Common commands include listing all the apps/tech as well as a single command update.

$ brew list - lists all apps/tech managed by Homebrew
$ brew doctor - diagnoses any problems
$ brew update - updates all apps/tech

Install Homebrew in terminal: $ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"

# Applications
$ brew cask install google-chrome
$ brew cask install slack
$ brew cask install postman
$ brew cask install atom
$ brew cask install visual-studio-code
$ brew cask install zoomus
$ brew cask install pgadmin4
# Technologies
$ brew install git

Ruby Version Manager
RVM allows you to run multiple versions of Ruby on your machine.

$ gpg --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB

$ \curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --rails

This command often fails (for me) the first time. Follow the instructions in the terminal to run the proper setup commands.

After installing the Ruby Version Manager CLOSE AND REOPEN TERMINAL! :)

To ensure rvm install properly, run:
$ rvm -v

Should see:

rvm 1.29.10 (latest) by Michal Papis, Piotr Kuczynski, Wayne E. Seguin [https://rvm.io]
$ rvm install 2.7.1 (or latest version of Ruby)

$ gem install rails
